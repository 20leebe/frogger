Created the game frogger using assembly. I used Mars 4.5 to create and run the program.
In order to run properly on Mars, the settings should be as follows
 - Unit width in pixels: 8
 - Unit height in pixels: 8
 - Display width in pixels: 256
 - Display height in pixels: 512
 - Base Address for Display: 0x10008000 ($gp)
